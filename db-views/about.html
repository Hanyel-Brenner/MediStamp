    <h1>What is Xquisidor?</h1><br>
    <div>
        <p>Xquisidor is right now the project for a general forum. A forum for people to talk about all sorts of things. In the future it is planned to implement many more ideas.
        The name you see right now might not even be the name I first intended for it to be, but the important is that it will grow and hopefully gather some people around.
